Access the live demo of the website [here](https://jarednjk.github.io/rocky-master/).

## Project Summary

### Project Context

Rockymaster is a mobile-responsive front-end page that sells western cafe food in Singapore.

### User Goals

With a rework of the website, users can now easily access important information from their mobile since it is now mobile-responsive. 

For a better user experience, only useful information is laid out from high to low priority to not flood users with too much information.

### Organisational Goals

This website aims to provide users with information about the food and promotions available through a user-friendly interface.

This attracts users to patronise the restaurants if they like what they see on the website.

### Justification for the App

The main purpose of creating this front-end landing page is to refresh the old website that is not mobile-responsive. the original website can be found [here](https://www.rockymaster.com.sg/).
